**Wifi driven sensor**


# Use case

It's a proof-of-concept device for metering passenger flows in realtime. It counts how many mobile devices are around. This gives an estimation how many people are around. Paxcounter detects Wifi and Bluetooth signals in the air, focusing on mobile devices by filtering vendor OUIs in the MAC adress.

Intention of this project is to do this without intrusion in privacy: You don't need to track people owned devices, if you just want to count them. Therefore, it does not persistenly store MAC adresses and does no kind of fingerprinting the scanned devices.

Data is transferred to a server via a LoRaWAN network, and/or a wired SPI slave interface.
